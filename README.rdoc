= Amir's Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it. This readme
needs changing since I forked it.

== Requirements

Install Ack. In Ubuntu do the following:

  sudo apt-get install ack-grep
  sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/local/bin/ack

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/amirhhz/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  rake install
